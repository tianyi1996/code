The final_try.ipynb file is the implementation process of my project. 
The process include: read data, feature extraction, training the classification model and the evaluation.
I also visualized some of the intermediate data processing steps in the end.

The best classification method is about 0.74.

However, I have not realized to use spark, I could just use sklearn to finish the feature extraction. I am trying to solve this
problem.
